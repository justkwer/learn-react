# React. Components

* ## Cards.

### Add React-Router version 6. Add header which shows the current page. Also add pages “About Us”, “404”. If user will input unknown route into url – application should redirect to “404”.

* ## Search Bar.

### Input value should be saved to LocalStorage during component’s unmount. During the initialization pick the value from LocalStorage and show it.

* ## Cards.

### The more details are on the card – the better.

* ## Tests.

### Add tests for components. Mock LocalStorage. Add test for one card, as well as tests for the list of all cards. You can use either React Testing Library or Enzyme, but only one of them. Preferr React Testing Library.
